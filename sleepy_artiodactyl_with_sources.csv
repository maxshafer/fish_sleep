The high levels at the beginning of each 24-h measurement were probably not only caused by diurnal activity of the animals but are also a reflection of stress as a response to the transfer into the respiration chambers.

This contrasted with the nearby serow, which was often active at night. These ob-servations were biased, however. because during the day the saola was exposed to un- familiar stimuli such as people, flies, and regular feedings, which may have induced some activity. Dung et aI. (1995) reportedfrom anecdotal infonnation that saola in the wild are active both day and night. Local people in the saola's range in Laos have  said that it is active mornings, late after- noons, sometimes at night, and not when the sun is overhead. ","Observations of a captive animal suggest that saola are crepuscular, or crepuscular and diurnal. Informants familiar with the animal in the wild report that it is most active in the morning, late afternoon and sometimes at night. At these times it reportedly descends to feed on streamside vegetation, then retreats to forested mountainsides to lie up and chew cud.

The age and sex of European bison had a statistically significant effect on the amount of time spent performing basic activities. The longest standing and moving times were observed in calves, while males spent most of their time resting- lying. In both zoological gardens, the increased feed intake activity was closely associated with feeding time, and the number of European bison resting lying was found to increase immediately after feed intake activity.","The activity rhythm of European bison w as found to consist of many phases, feeding phases being interspersed with rest.

Our analysis suggested that the activity pattern of Przewalski’s gazelle had changed from diurnal (Chen et al. 1997) to crepuscular during the 10-year period from 1996 and 2005. During this time the human population density, livestock density and pastoral practices in the area have changed little (Jiang 2004). Therefore, it is reasonable to attribute the changes in activity patterns as a response to traffic flow on the new highway, which bisects the species’ original habitat.","In spring, the major behavior of the animal was feeding, the time budget of feeding occupied 65.56% of all diurnal time and showed three peaks: morning (7:00～ 9:00; 68.07%～73.47% ) , afternoon (13: 00～ 14: 00; 83.94% ) and dusk (15:00～ 17:00; 98.57%～ 84.93% ).Meanwhile, the moving occupied 5.17% , standing and gazing time was 2.67% , bedding time was 26.55% and other activities, 0.03%. 　　In Summer, feeding behavior remained a major activity and showed three peaks :afternoon (13:00～ 14:00; 81.93% ) , late afternoon (16: 00～ 17:00; 78.15% ) and one hour before sunset ( 18 : 00～ 19 : 00; 60.77% ).","","","","https://doi.org/10.1071/WR08117","https://www.mammal.cn/EN/abstract/abstract1781.shtml","","","","","",NA,NA,NA
