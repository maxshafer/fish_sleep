Our ability to detect such an effect may be limited by the constraints imposed by the instruments, which allowed the collection of only histogram summary data during 4 periods of equal duration during the day. Continuous data, or a subsample thereof, might be a better test for the existence of a cyclical pattern in diving behaviour. In southern latitudes, the vast majority of zooplankton taxa perform diel vertical migration (DVM) (Longhurst 1976). As a result, several planktivorous whale species adjust their foraging behaviour accordingly and track the vertical migrations of their prey (Croll et al. 2005, Doniol-Valcroze et al. 2011). However, summer months at higher latitudes are characterized by up to 24 h of daylight and zooplankton do not perform DVM (Blachowiak-Samolyk et al. 2006), their vertical distribution probably being mostly influenced by sea ice cover and hydrodynamic factors (Buchanan & Haney 1980)","","","https://www.jstor.org/stable/40512894","https://www.jstor.org/stable/40512155","https://doi.org/10.3354/esr00373","","","","","","","","","cathemeral/crepuscular"

The increase in vocalization rates during the day might be attributed to either reduced feeding  and increased socializing (which may be accompanied by more acoustic  activity  to  facilitate  interactions  between  individuals) or switching to another prey species (which may  be accompanied by increased vocalization rates to either coordinate activities among individuals or to agonistically maintain control over patchy prey resources).","there is some suggestion that calling rates within 3km of the anchor stations during 2007 also exhibited diel periodicity, but in the opposite direction (higher calling rates by night than day).","If sei whales were as adept at feeding at the surface during the night as during the day, then we might expect them to be present during periods of strong DVM.

These observations together suggest that sei whales may prefer to feed on C. finmarchicus at the surface during the day. *Based on boat-based observations during daylight, they found a pattern of sei whales tending to feed on copepods at the surface during daytime when they exhibit little/no DVM, this contradicts the tagging study where they dive deeper during the day to feed on migrating copepods.

This diel pattern may be related to the blue whale feeding ecology...At our latitudes, the main prey of blue whales are especially krill (Euphausia vallentini and Euphausia frigida), as well as myctophids (Myctophum punctatum) [49, 53]. Although the diel migration of these species is not well documented in our study area, they are known to migrate at lower depth and to be more diverse and dense at night [54–56]. This would explain the lesser number of calls of Antarctic blue whales at night and validate the trade-off between feeding and vocalizing activities formulated in previous studies ","Whales dove to significantly greater depths during the day compared to nighttime (day: 32.6 ± 18.7 m; night: 6.2 ± 2.7 m; P < 0.01).

Daytime feeding behavior was essentially bimodal, taking place either in relatively shallow waters (<40 m) or at depths of about 70–100 m, with some lunges occurring at intermediate depths during twilight... Feeding occurred throughout the diurnal cycle but lunges were twice as frequent at night than during daytime (average of 1 lunge every 2.1 min at night vs. every 4.2 min during daytime). The number of lunges per dive was lower and less variable at night (1.25 ± 0.53 SD) than during daytime (2.18 ± 1.69 SD).","The hourly rate of B calls showed a strong diel pattern. There were significantly more calls during dark and twilight periods than during light periods (P < 0.001). These diel patterns in call production correlate well with previously established diel patterns in prey distribution, with the highest calling rates occurring when prey have been reported to be closest to the surface...It is possible that the diel patterns in sound production reported here and in Thompson (1965) are an artefact of the diving behaviour of blue whales. Blue whales may vocalize at the same rate during all hours of the day, but if they are unable to produce loud, low-frequency sounds at the deeper depths to which they dive during daylight hours, then fewer sounds will be recorded.

She was also active between 1800 and 2200 hr, although less active than during the day. In some days, JJ was active at night. These periods did not evidently correlate with any particular changes around the pool complex (e.g., activity of people or sounds of killer whales coming from the nearby pool complex). The transitional stage (stage 2) was distributed evenly during each 24-hr period. Periods of rest at the surface (Fig. 2B) occurred typically in late afternoon and throughout the night, rarely between 0700 and 1700 hr. In contrast, episodes of rest on the bottom were evenly distributed over each 24-hr period except between 0600 and 0800 hr during the first daily feeding (Fig. 2C)... We think that this pattern of diurnal activity in JJ was related to patterns of human presence and activity near the pool. Almost every morning, a transition from rest to activity in JJ’s behavior corresponded with an increase in noise associated with nearby preparation of her food. Consequently, we think that the night-time rest period might have been longer if not interrupted by this activity.

One hypothesis is that at the Emerald South site, right whales feed primarily at night when the relatively sparse concentrations of Calanus have migrated to the surface (Baumgartner et al. 2003a) and that they spend relatively more time socializing or otherwise making contact calls when not feeding during the day.","One site, Roseway West, had significantly more gunshot sounds overall and exhibited a clear diel trend in production of these signals at night.

As a result, small groups tend to meander, apparently searching for food, in the earlier morning hours. They often find food from about midmorning to noon and aggregate at that time. Most feeding in large groups occurs in the afternoon. The dolphins break into smaller groups again in the evening or at night, and spend the night resting at the surface with very little net movement... *vs New Zealand dusky dolphins* During the summer and fall months, the dolphins tend to be very close to land, often within several hundred meters of shore, in the early morning. In the late afternoon and evening, they are usually found moving gradually into deeper waters, possibly to meet the rising DSL in pelagic waters during the night…Once again, movement near shore while not feeding may be related to resting and predator avoidance.","Daytime feeding activity was noted in 72% of groups in Admiralty Bay as opposed to <1% of groups in Kaikoura.Behavioural data from 20 min focal-group samples demonstrate that dusky dolphin groups in Admiralty Bay fed during the daytime significantly more than groups in Kaikoura.

Offshore movements were observed most often in later time blocks in spring, summer and fall but were spread more evenly thoughout the day in winter...New Zealand dusky dolphin behavior most closely parallels that of Hawaiian spinner dolphins which rest in shallow protected bays during the day, move more rapidly with increased numbers of aerial activities in late afternoon, then move rapidly offshore to feed at night on prey associated with the Deep Scattering Layer (Norris and Dohl 1980). Unlike Hawaiian spinners, New Zealand dusky dolphins perform this daily onshore/offshore movement only during non-winter months, possibly because of increased susceptibility to predation during the breeding and calving season ... Dolphins radio-tracked in summer months usually stayed offshore throughout the night and were found close to shore again the next morning.

Instead, the differences in diving behaviour were likely also related to day–night differences in the diving behaviour of their prey and (or) to differences in ambient light. High levels of down-welling light during the day could enable a strategy of foraging using visual cues at greater depths than would be possible during the night.

In the Baltic Sea, acoustic detections have been suggested to be linked to pelagic prey of porpoises, e.g. herring, that could be easier accessed at night [52]. Herring shows decreased predator avoidance mechanisms during the night, being closer to the surface in less aggregated schools and reduced swimming speed [72,73]. This could be reflected in porpoise behaviour as supported by a previous study [4] and therefore buzz rates may increase at certain times of the day due to porpoises following the vertical distribution of their prey. In contrast to these findings from the Baltic Sea a major prey item of harbour porpoises in the North Sea, the sandeel [29,74,75], shows a diurnal vertical migration pattern feeding on surface zooplankton during the day and buries itself in sand at night especially in spring time [76]. This would explain diurnal patterns in our data in addition to nocturnal patterns possibly linked to other prey species.","Furthermore, there was a striking diel pattern in porpoise activity at Læsø Trindel, with significantly higher activity during the night. This pattern became increasingly apparent over the study period. At the reference station, in contrast, most activity took place during the day through-out the study. The results suggest that these changes reflect a new food source which occurs at night on the re-established stony reef and is exploited by the porpoises.","https://doi.org/10.3354/meps12118","https://doi.org/10.1111/mms.12112","https://doi.org/10.47536/jcrm.v9i3.668","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0213348","https://doi.org/10.3354/meps10260","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-7692.2012.00592.x","https://doi.org/10.1111/mms.12951","https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsp035","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2017.09.015","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.10.051","https://doi.org/10.1111/mms.12880","nocturnal/crepuscular"

A sampling scheme considering daylight only, would give this category a marginal weight in the total acoustic activity, while nacchere are the most frequent signal present at night in the whole study area... Striped dolphins were observed diving, at night, in concomitance with this sound, and they, with maybe other dolphin species, should be considered as the source of this class of signals. The authors suggest nacchere are produced by dolphins feeding in prey rich layers during the daily zooplankton concentration and vertical migration.","From these three aspects of our results, we can propose a distribution shift of these striped dolphins: schools are freuent close to the shelf break during the night, where they feed (this latter point is clear from the acoustic recordings). During the morning, an offshore directed travel results in the dolphins moving to deeper waters, where their movement is randomly distributed. During the late evening and dusk periods, an inshore directed movement occurs, resulting in an increased presence of dolphins over shallower waters.","The night acoustic results show the presence and the intense activity of feeding of the striped dolphin close to the shelf break. The day distribution shows a marked preference of the striped dolphin for the open sea and the near-shore waters...This study presents the scheme of an horizontal diel migration cycle, consistent with the nocturnal feeding of dolphins close to the shelf, and a diurnal offshore-inshore movement, whose motivation is not precisely known. ","There is little information, however, on the feeding behaviour of these dolphins, thus it is also likely that they feed mostly on non-commercial species and during the night, utilizing the diurnal migration of prey fish and cephalopods.
